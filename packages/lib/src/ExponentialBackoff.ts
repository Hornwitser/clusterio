/**
 * Helper class for implementing the exponential backoff algorithm
 *
 * Provides a convenient interface for implementing an exponential backoff
 * when reconnecting or resending in a distributed network.
 *
 * Once instantiated the delay method will return the next interval to wait
 * for in milliseconds before making another attempt.  For each attempt the
 * delay chosen is a random value between 0 and the current maximum delay
 * wwhich starts at a value of 2 * `base` and doubles for ever attempt up to
 * the passed value of `max`.  The value for the delay will reset back to
 * `base` if more time than the value for `reset` has passed between two
 * invocations of delay.
