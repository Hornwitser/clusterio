	 * - `stopped`: Instance is no longer running or was just assigned to a
	 *   host.

	 * - `stopping`: Instance is in the processing stopping.
	 * - `creating_save`: Instance is in the process of creating a save.
	 * - `exporting_data`: Instance is in the process of exporting item
	 *   icons and locale data.
	 * - `deleted`: Instance was deleted.

	 * they are assigned to a host, when the host then connects to the
	 * controller and informs of the current status of its instances this hook

	 * checking if prev equals `unknown`.  If the host disconnects the
	 * instances will again get the `unknown` status.

	 * change with prev set to null.  While the status of new instances is
	 * in most cases `unassigned` it's possible for the created instance to
	 * start with any state in some host connection corner cases.

	 * the case of network outages if reconnect fails to re-establish the
